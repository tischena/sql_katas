# SQL Katas Collection

This file contains a series of small, self-contained SQL exercises designed to practice and demonstrate common SQL concepts such as:

- window functions
- aggregations
- joins
- subqueries
- CTEs
- ranking and analytic functions
- filtering and grouping logic

Each query is written to be:

- readable and reusable
- database-agnostic where possible
- easy to test using pytest and temporary in-memory databases

The katas are intended for learning, experimentation, and reference when building ETL pipelines or database logic.
